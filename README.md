# 30DayMapChallenge :world_map:

**My submissions to the 2022 [#30DayMapChallenge](https://www.achim-tack.org/30daymapchallenge).**

I've been meaning to develop my spatial data visualization skills and what better way to finally take action than to participate in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://www.achim-tack.org/30daymapchallenge) created by the phenomenal geographer, [Topi Tjukanov](https://tjukanov.org/)?! The idea is to publish a map every day of November aligned with a specified theme. In addition to the themes prescribed by Topi, my maps will all be related to three themes I am passionate about: cats :smiley_cat:, sloths :sloth:, and energy :bulb:. My good friend and colleague correctly referred to this amalgamation of themes as chaotic, but maybe I'll find some way to tie them all together...I also have the ambitious goal of learning and applying a variety of mapping tools throughout the challenge, from QGIS to R. Let's see how it goes!

A map a day keeps the doctor away...

**Tools used:**

| Tool  | Map count| 
| ------|----------| 
| QGIS  |    5     | 
| Python|    2     | 
| R     |          | 
| Other |          | 

Day 1: Points 🟣

Are you an introvert like me and would rather sip coffee with cats than humans? Well then, a cat cafe might be perfect for you. Cat cafes [originated in Taiwan in 1998](https://catcafesd.com/about/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20Japanese%20tourists,has%20over%20150%20cat%20cafes) and have since become popular across the globe, especially in Japan, which has over 150 cat cafes with over 30 of them located in Tokyo. This map shows the abundance of cat cafes in Tokyo City 🗼 😸!

Day 2: Lines 〰️

While making my day 1 map, I learned about Japan's abundant river network and was inspired to represent the country by its rivers. It's not surprising, looking at this map, to learn that [hydropower accounts for almost half of Japan’s overall renewable electricity generation](https://www.hydropower.org/publications/2022-hydropower-status-report). The country pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and hydropower has a major role to play in fulfilling this commitment.

Day 3 - Polygons 🟪

Total # of meow meows rescued by animal shelters in each U.S. state (contiguous) in 2021 

This was my first time using #Plotly with #Python and it had a bit of a learning curve, so this map isn't as detailed as I'd like it to be, but I need to time box myself throughout the challenge! After completing this map, I realized Hawaii and Alaska are missing so this only applies to the contiguous states...

Day 4 - Green 🟩

This map is meant to accompany a recent [Guardian article](https://bit.ly/3WtwOmy) written about forest loss in the DRC due to unsustainable harvesting of biomass for cooking.

Large-scale transitions to #cleancooking are needed to protect people and the planet.

Originally, I had loss portrayed as red, but red-green color blind folks wouldn't be able to see it, so I went with purple :). I'm trying to learn about accessibility as I make maps.

Day 5 - Ukraine 🇺🇦

Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, which powers nearly half of its electricity supply. In March, Russian armed forces took control of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

This animated map shows daily new conflict events between February 24th and October 21st, in relation to nuclear power plant locations (minus the decommissioned Chernobyl plant). Data for this map comes from: ACLED.

Day 6 - Networks 🕸️

Nepal has ambitious climate targets and aims to achieve net-zero by 2050. The country has plans to leverage its immense hydropower potential to meet its goals and energy sovereignty.

Here is Nepal's existing electricity transmission network:

P.S. Can you spot the cross-border transmission line between Nepal & India?! This line is crucial for power trade between the two countries.
