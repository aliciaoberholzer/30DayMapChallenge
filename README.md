# 30DayMapChallenge :world_map:

**My submissions to the 2022 [#30DayMapChallenge](https://www.achim-tack.org/30daymapchallenge).**

I've been meaning to develop my spatial data visualization skills and what better way to finally take action than to participate in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://www.achim-tack.org/30daymapchallenge) created by the phenomenal geographer, [Topi Tjukanov](https://tjukanov.org/)?! The idea is to publish a map every day of November aligned with a specified theme. In addition to the themes prescribed by Topi, my maps will all be related to three themes I am passionate about: cats :smiley_cat:, sloths :sloth:, and energy access :sunny:. My good friend and colleague correctly referred to this amalgamation of themes as chaotic, but maybe I'll find some way to tie them all together...I also have the ambitious goal of learning and applying a variety of mapping tools throughout the challenge, from QGIS to R. Let's see how it goes!

A map a day keeps the doctor away...

**Tools used:**

| Tool  | Map count| 
| ------|----------| 
| QGIS  |   1      | 
| Python|          | 
| R     |          | 
| ArcGIS|          | 

**Day 1: Points :purple_circle:**

Are you an introvert like me and would rather sip coffee with cats than humans? Well then, a cat cafe might be perfect for you. Cat cafes originated in [Taiwan in 1998](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/paying-purrs-japans-cat-cafes-180949536/) and have since become popular across the globe, especially in Japan, which has over 150 cat cafes with over 30 of them located in Tokyo. This map shows the abundance of cat cafes in Tokyo City :tokyo_tower: :smile_cat:!
